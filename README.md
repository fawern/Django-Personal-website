# Django-Personal-website

As someone who has a deep love for reading, I've always enjoyed sharing the stories of the books I've read with those around me. However, my audience has been limited to the people in my immediate vicinity. So, I thought, why not create a website for this? The idea is to categorize books by authors and allow others to explore the books I've read, along with the personal comments and reviews I've written for each one. This way, anyone interested can discover and engage with the novels I've enjoyed over the years.
